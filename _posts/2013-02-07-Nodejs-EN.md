We are excited to announce the latest edition of the Shanghai Open Source events, which is dedicated to bring the community together and provide a platform for Open Source enthusiasts in Shanghai to communicate and share their thoughts.

Please come and join us for a Node.js event at our Shanghai office where our [team](http://wiredcraft.com/), as well as other javascript gurus, will be waiting to greet you. We will provide several high level presentations and workshop; however, we are welcoming any  from our participants. If you wish you can prepare a speech to give, or just make an impromptu speech at the time. If you do prepare ahead of time, please send a quick email about your topic(s) to info@shanghaios.org. We are finalizing the schedule and will update the event information accordingly.

If you love Open Source and are eager to know more open source people, all you need to do is simply sign up on our [Weibo page](http://event.weibo.com/760436) and join us! If you wish to help us or contribute to this event or future ones, let us know.
