We are excited to announce the latest edition of the Shanghai Open Source events, which is dedicated to bring the community together and provide a platform for Open Source enthusiasts in Shanghai to communicate and share their thoughts.

Please come and join us for a Node.js event at our Shanghai office where our [team](http://wiredcraft.com/), as well as other javascript gurus, will be waiting to greet you. We will provide several high level presentations and workshop; however, we are welcoming any  from our participants. If you wish you can prepare a speech to give, or just make an impromptu speech at the time. If you do prepare ahead of time, please send a quick email about your topic(s) to info@shanghaios.org.

If you love Open Source and are eager to know more open source people, all you need to do is simply sign up on our [Weibo page](http://event.weibo.com/760436) and join us! If you wish to help us or contribute to this event or future ones, let us know.
