We are happy to announce the launch of a series of Shanghai Open Source events, to bring the community together and provide a platform for Open Source enthusiasts in Shanghai to communicate and share their thinking. We will hold this event on the second Saturday of every month.

So, join us for a BBQ at the [Gold Cider](http://www.goldcider.com) (kindly hosting us) where the [Wiredcraft](http://wiredcraft.com/) and [Yunio](http://beta.yunio.com) teams will greet you.

The only thing you need to do is to join us! If you wish to help us or contribute to this event or future ones, let us know. If you love Open Source, are eager to know more open source people while enjoying nice food, simply [sign up](http://eepurl.com/o9bBz) and join us!
